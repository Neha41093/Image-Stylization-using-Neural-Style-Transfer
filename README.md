# Image-Stylization-using-Neural-Style-Transfer

Photographs are an excellent medium of expression. While we may like the structure, substance or ‘content’ portrayed by one photo, we may like the colors, texture, patterns or simply put, the ‘style’ that we perceive in others. In the recent years, editing or stylizing images has become rather easy and has widespread use, for example in mobile applications like Fritz, Pikazo, Prisma, MaeSTrO, etc. Neural Style Transfer allows us to see the content of an image stylized in the pattern of another. 

Neural style transfer is one of the most creative applications of convolutional neural networks. In this project we aim to implement Neural style Transfer on images from across genres using different filters. We have also implemented a novel feature of ‘auto-styling’ wherein we
use a set of different style reference images on the input image, and based on quantitative metrics come up with the style that is perceived as the most suitable for the input.
